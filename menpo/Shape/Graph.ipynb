    "This notebook presents the basic concepts behind Menpo's `Graph` class and subclasses. The aim of this notebook is to introduce the user to Graph _very_ basic functionality; a preliminary step before moving on to the `PointGraph` notebook. For higher level functionality along with visualization methods, the user is encouraged to go through the `PointGraph` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic `Graph` subclasses are:\n",
    "* `UndirectedGraph`: graphs with undirected edge connections\n",
    "* `DirectedGraph`: graphs with directed edge connections\n",
    "* `Tree`: directed graph in which any two vertices are connected with exactly one path\n",
    "\n",
    "**The corresponding subclasses of `PointGraph` are basically `Graph`s with geometry (`PointCloud`)**. This means that apart from the edge connections between vertices, they also define spatial location coordinates for each vertex. The `PointGraph` subclasses are:\n",
    "* `PointUndirectedGraph`: graphs with undirected edge connections\n",
    "* `PointDirectedGraph`: graphs with directed edge connections\n",

In Menpo, we assume that the vertices in $V$ are numbered with consecutive positive integer numbers starting from 0, i.e. $V=\\{0, 1, \\ldots, |V|\\}$. By defining an edge between two vertices $v_i, v_j\\in V$ as $e_{ij}=(v_i,v_j)$, the set of edges can be represented as $E=\\{e_{ij}\\}, \\forall i,j:(v_i,v_j)~\\text{is edge}$.\n",
